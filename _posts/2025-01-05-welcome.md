### Hello and weloome to my blog. <br />
This is my first blog. As a cybersecurity student I came to gitHub to learn about secure coding and develope my own technical skills. I hope to work with others on secure coding, malware/vulnerability detection. <br />

As my skills and network grows I will continue to add new repositories, and code. It would be amazing to expand my network and create some friends along the way as well.
